## Installation
```sh
yarn add fast-loops
```
Alternatively use `npm i --save fast-loops`.

## Why?
Because JavaScript's native "functional" APIs such as `forEach`, `reduce`, `map` and `filter` are slow. There're many different utility packages out there already, e.g. lodash. But lodash's `reduce` method itself is 4.5kb gzipped which is way too much for a simple Array/Object reduce utility.
